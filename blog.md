# Animation Blog
*by Guillermo Montecinos, NYU ITP Fall 2018*

## Week 1 - Stop Motion
For the animation class first assignment we were committed to develop a motion animation, project in which I collaborated with [Idit Barak](https://wp.nyu.edu/iditbarak/category/class-work/cl-animation/) and [David Azar](https://www.davidazar.mx/blog/first-animation-ever).

The first question we asked was *what story to tell?*, which is a great question because it is never easy to start with a blank canvas. After a short brainstorming we realized that wanted to make a world where electronic elements came to life -elements that for many became part of their imaginary after joining ITP. Capacitors as fat people, IC's as bugs and resistors as zombies, a whole world of fantastic creatures -that I've imagined since my time at Engineering School- but not a story to tell.
