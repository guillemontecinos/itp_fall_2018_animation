## Week 1 - Stop Motion
For the animation class first assignment we were committed to develop a motion animation, project in which I collaborated with [Idit Barak](https://wp.nyu.edu/iditbarak/category/class-work/cl-animation/) and [David Azar](https://www.davidazar.mx/blog/first-animation-ever).

The first question we asked ourselves was *what story to tell?*, which is a great question because it's never easy to start with a blank canvas. After a short brainstorming we realized we wanted to make a world where electronic elements came to life: capacitors as fat people, IC's as bugs and resistors as zombies, a whole world of fantastic creatures -that I've imagined since my time at Engineering School- but not a story to tell.

The story of a family of bugs became into a competition of electronic components which later became into the "Led Olympics": we wanted to recreate the olympic games with components but the time constraint -30 seconds of animation- gave us the answer: *why not just LEDs wrestling?*.

So we made the LED's to be wrestlers and the breadborad to be the fight arena. Apart from the LED's we made a resistor to be the referee, two capacitors to be the commentators and a bunch of other components to be the audience. The shoot took about 5 hours and we did it in one night.

The post-shooting consisted in editing the video and adding sound to the crowd and the characters. We recorded gibberish sounds for the characters voices and used open sound effects for the crowd, the fight sounds and the boxing bell. The final result of this work can be seen following the next link.
