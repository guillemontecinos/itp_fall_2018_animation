# Animation Blog

## Week 1 - Stop Motion
For the animation class first assignment we were committed to develop a motion animation, project in which I collaborated with [Idit Barak](https://wp.nyu.edu/iditbarak/category/class-work/cl-animation/) and [David Azar](https://www.davidazar.mx/blog/first-animation-ever).

The first question we asked ourselves was *what story to tell?*, which is a great question because it's never easy to start with a blank canvas. After a short brainstorming we realized we wanted to make a world where electronic elements came to life: capacitors as fat people, IC's as bugs and resistors as zombies, a whole world of fantastic creatures -that I've imagined since my time at Engineering School- but not a story to tell.

The story of a family of bugs became into a competition of electronic components which later became into the "Led Olympics": we wanted to recreate the olympic games with components but the time constraint -30 seconds of animation- gave us the answer: *why not just LEDs wrestling?*.
